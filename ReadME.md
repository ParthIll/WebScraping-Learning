# Web Scraping Learning Project

This project was created as a learning exercise for web scraping.

## Tools Used

- **Anaconda**: For managing Python environments and packages.
- **Beautiful Soup**: For parsing HTML and extracting data from web pages.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
2. Create a new environment (optional):
    ```
    conda create -n webscraping python=3.10
    conda activate webscraping
    ```
3. Install Beautiful Soup:
    ```
    conda install beautifulsoup4
    ```

## Purpose

This repository contains code and notes from my experiments and learning process with web scraping in Python.
